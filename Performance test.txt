This note is to compare the performance between two versions of Kyanh's (me!:D) test generator
Objective: Generate only input tests (1000 tests)
- Original: 0.635 s
- New: 0.781 s
Objective: Generate both input & output tests (1000 tests)
- Original: 28.458 s
- New: 25.011 s
(Checked this multiple times, it gives approximately that result shows that new one is faster than old one:)))
